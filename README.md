# es6-modules

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

This is a repo that demonstrates the different ways to use ES6 modules and how
[Babel](http://babeljs.io/) can be used to transpile these into different formats
that work in browsers today.

I'm using it in my talk at [this event](https://www.bigmarker.com/modernweb/ES6-Modules-Mastering-Chrome-Developer-Tools-and-more)
and will hopefully have a link to the event soon. The slides can be found [here](http://kcd.im/es6-modules)

Be aware that Babel has to do some stuff to get its job done that may mislead you
a bit (and this can lead to [tears](http://kcd.im/tears). It's always good to
understand the specification:
